/**
   Notes: 
   1. a data type such as int or double is a group of values and operations on those values 
   that is defined within a specific programming language
   2. An ADT, is a specification for a group of values and the operations on those values 
   that is defined conceptually and independently of any programming language
   3. A data structure is an implementation of an ADT within a programming language.
   4. A collection is an object that groups other objects and provides services to its client
   5. A typical collection enables a client to add, remove, retrieve, and query the objects 
   it represents. 
   6. Behaviors are specified abstractly and can differ in purpose according to the collection.
   Thus, a collection is an abstraction and is an abstract data type. 
   7. To provide an example of a collection and of an abstract data type, we will specify 
   and use the ADT bag.
   8. Now, write Java headers for the bagâ€™s methods and organize them into a Java interface 
   for the class that will implement the ADT. 
   9. The Java interface contains the methods for an ADT bag and detailed comments that 
   describe their behaviors.

/*
To accommodate entries of any one class type, the bag methods use a generic type T for 
each entry. To give meaning to the identifier T, we must write <T> after the name of the 
interface. Once the actual data type is chosen within a client, the compiler will use that 
data type wherever T appears. . All entries in the bag then must have either that data type 
or a subtype of that data type. The compiler will enforce this restriction for us.
