# GuessingGame

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This Java program allows you to guess three randomly selected integers within a specified range.

## How to Play

1. **Getting Started**: Run the program, and you will be greeted with a welcome message.

2. **Enter Your Guesses**: You will be prompted to enter your guesses for three integers. These integers should be in the range from 1 to 9.

3. **Guessing Logic**: Your guesses will be compared to three randomly selected integers.

4. **Results**: The program will provide feedback on your guesses, informing you if your guesses are correct or incorrect.

5. **Winning**: If you guess all three numbers correctly, you win the game! The program will announce your victory.

## Program Details

- The program generates three random integers within the range of 1 to 9.

- You are asked to make three guesses to match these random integers.

- The program provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether each guess is correct or not.

- The game continues until you correctly guess all three integers or decide to exit the program.

## Implementation Details

- The program uses the Java `Scanner` class to read user input for guesses.

- It generates random integers using the `Random` class within the specified range.

- The program may use data structures such as arrays and interfaces (`BagInterface`) to manage and compare the guesses with the random integers.

## Prerequisites

- You need Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to run this program.
